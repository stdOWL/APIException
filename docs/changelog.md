# 📝 Changelog

All notable changes to APIException will be documented here.
This project uses *Semantic Versioning*.


## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-23
### Added
- **Advanced logging customizations** in `register_exception_handlers`:
  - `log_level`: override verbosity for exception logging.
  - `log_request_context`: toggle to include/exclude request headers in logs.
  - `log_header_keys`: define which headers are logged (default: `x-request-id`, `user-agent`, etc.).
  - `extra_log_fields`: inject custom structured metadata into logs (e.g. `user_id`, masked API keys).
- **Response headers echo** in `register_exception_handlers`:
  - `response_headers=True` → default headers echoed back.
  - `response_headers=False` → no headers echoed.
  - `response_headers=("x-user-id",)` → custom headers echoed.
- `APIException` now accepts header parameters (headers can carry custom values into responses).
- **Mypy** support added for static type checking.
- Improved documentation for `register_exception_handlers` with usage patterns, logging, and examples.


### Changed
- Logging format has been revamped → now more structured, readable, and consistent.
- Error logging now includes richer metadata: request path, method, client IP, HTTP version, etc.

### Fixed
- Swagger/OpenAPI sometimes showed inconsistent error schemas when `data` was missing.
- **File structure cleanup**: imports in `__init__.py` were fixed and simplified.  
  The package is now easier to import and fully modular.
- Fixed a type issue where `error_code` was not properly annotated as `BaseExceptionCode`.

## [0.1.21] - 2025-08-18
✅ Stable release!
✅ **Initial stable and suggested version**

### Fixed
- Added missing `import traceback` in `__init__.py`.  
  This resolves a `NameError` when using `register_exception_handlers` with traceback logging enabled.


## [0.1.20] - 2025-08-18

#### Changed
- Refactored `__init__.py` to use relative imports (`from .module import ...`) for cleaner packaging and better IDE compatibility.
- Unified and simplified `__all__` so developers can import everything directly from `api_exception` (e.g. `from api_exception import ResponseModel, APIException`).

#### Fixed
- Resolved IDE red import warnings when using the library in external projects.
- Improved top-level import resolution and consistency across modules.


## [0.1.19] - 2025-08-18

#### Added
- Unified import interface: all core classes and functions can now be imported directly from `api_exception` (e.g. `from api_exception import ResponseModel, APIException`).
- Cleaner `__init__.py` exports with `__all__`.

#### Changed
- Internal imports refactored, simplified folder structure for `enums.py`, `response_model.py`, `rfc7807_model.py`.

#### Fixed
- Example and README imports updated to use new unified style.


## [0.1.18] - 2025-08-17


### Added
- Global logging control (`set_global_log`) with `log` param in `register_exception_handlers`.
- RFC7807 full support with `application/problem+json` responses.
- Automatic injection of `data: null` in OpenAPI error examples.

### Changed
- Dependency pins relaxed (`>=` instead of strict `==`).
- Docstrings and examples updated (`use_response_model` → `response_format`).
- Unified error logging (no logs when `log=False`).

### Fixed
- Fallback middleware now returns HTTP 500 instead of 422 for unexpected errors.
- Traceback scope bug fixed in handlers.
